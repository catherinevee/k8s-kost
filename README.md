# Kubernetes Cost Optimizer & Predictor

A comprehensive B2B application designed to help organizations optimize Kubernetes cluster costs in real-time, right-size their resources, and predict future spending patterns.

## Application Purpose

The Kubernetes Cost Optimizer is a specialized tool that addresses the critical challenge of managing and optimizing costs in Kubernetes environments. As organizations scale their containerized applications, understanding and controlling infrastructure costs becomes increasingly complex. This application provides:

- **Real-time cost visibility** across all Kubernetes resources
- **Intelligent resource optimization** recommendations
- **Predictive cost analysis** for better budget planning
- **Automated cost management** workflows
- **Multi-cloud cost aggregation** and analysis

## How It Works

### Core Functionality

The application operates through a sophisticated data collection and analysis pipeline:

1. **Data Collection**: Continuously monitors Kubernetes cluster metrics, resource usage, and cloud provider billing data
2. **Cost Analysis**: Processes raw metrics into cost calculations using cloud provider pricing models
3. **Optimization Engine**: Analyzes resource utilization patterns to identify optimization opportunities
4. **Recommendation System**: Generates actionable recommendations with confidence scores and risk assessments
5. **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides live updates and alerts for cost anomalies and optimization opportunities

### Technical Architecture

The application is built with a microservices architecture consisting of:

- **Backend API**: Go-based REST API with WebSocket support for real-time updates
- **Frontend Dashboard**: React-based progressive web application with interactive visualizations
- **Data Pipeline**: Multi-level caching system with PostgreSQL (TimescaleDB) for time-series data
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus and Grafana for observability and alerting
- **Cloud Integrations**: Support for AWS, Azure, and GCP billing APIs

### Data Flow

```
Kubernetes Cluster → Metrics Collection → Cost Analysis → Optimization Engine → Dashboard
     ↓                      ↓                    ↓              ↓              ↓
Resource Usage        Prometheus Data    Cost Calculations   Recommendations  User Interface
     ↓                      ↓                    ↓              ↓              ↓
Cloud Billing APIs → Cost Aggregation → Historical Analysis → Risk Assessment → Real-time Alerts
```
